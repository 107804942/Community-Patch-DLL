To use the Community Balance Overhaul with CSD, C4DF, or EUI, you must use ALL THREE of these mods, and install the Community Balance Overhaul - Compatibility Files Mod (EUI). If not using EUI, use the (non-EUI) version of this mod.

Once these mods are installed, DELETE the LUA folders in the Community Balance Overhaul and the Community Patch.
